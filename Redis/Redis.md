# Redis - NoSQL database

## <em> Redis is a source-available, in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Because it holds all data in memory and because of its design, Redis offers low-latency reads and writes, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require a cache. Redis is the most popular NoSQL database, and one of the most popular databases overall. <em> - wikipedia (the most trust worthy site) :D
